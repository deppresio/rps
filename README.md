# rps

Create function called computerPlay that randomly returns "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
	test with console
write function that plays a single round of rps. Should take two parameters--playerSelection and computerSelection, 
then
return string that declares the winner of the round: "You lose! Paper beats Rock"
	make sure the playerSelection is not case sensitive
Note--you want to return the results of this funciton call, not console.log() them. Can test with console log though?
Write a new function called game(). use the previous function in this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and 
reports a winner or loser at the end. 
	Since I don't know loops, just use playround five times in a row.
	Display results of each round with console.log()
	use prompt() to get input from the user. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt
	Rework previous function if needed. Maybe return value should be something more useful.
	Can create more helper functions if useful.
